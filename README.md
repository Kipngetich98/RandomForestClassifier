The most pressing questions for banks are how efficiently can we guage the risk profile of our customers and how can we use this information to decide on the required liquidity while still maintaining our regulatory obligations.

With the constantly changing customer portfolio and the ever increasing customer base a more robust non-hardcoded approach is neccessary to achieve these antagonistic goals.

Thus comes the idea of using machine learning to develop a behavioural scorecard to pull data from both internal sources, customer transactions and their demographic data, to predict the probability of default.
